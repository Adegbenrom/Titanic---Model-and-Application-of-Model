Author: Michael Olusola Adegbenro #### There are a lot of works on Titianic event that focus on visual presentation and analysis of data but this work focuses more on model training and aplication of trained model.   - Assumed train dataset is obtained from the client. Train dataset contains both dependent and independent variables - Train dataset is then used to train a model and the accuracy is check. - Test dataset is then used to test the model and a new dataset is created for client to make decision on - I further confirmed the accuracy of the new dataset obtained from model.
